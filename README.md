# sound_tab
Chrome extension to quickly switch to tabs emitting sounds

Quickly switch to tabs that are making sounds by clicking the extension icon or by the shortcut Alt+Shift+S. 

If two or more tabs are playing sounds, the extension will cycle through all of those tabs with each press.

The default shortcut is Alt+Shift+S. Keybindings can be edited through the "Keyboard Shortcut" menu at chrome://extensions/shortcuts
